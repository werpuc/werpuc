### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Weronika PuchaÅ‚a and I'm a PhD candidate in IBB PAS in Warsaw, Poland.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the new version of [HaDeX](https://hadex.mslab-ibb.pl/), the novel tool for visualization of data from HDX-MS experiments. I'm the creator and maintainer of the HaDeX package, available on CRAN. The main idea is described in our [article](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/16/4516/5862011?login=true).
